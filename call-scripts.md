---

### Offer Presentation (3-5 Minutes)

**Transition:**
"Thank you for sharing that. Based on the information you provided and our analysis of comparable sales in your area, here's what we can offer..."

**The Offer:**
"We can offer **$[Amount]** for your property at [Address]."

**[PAUSE - Let them process]**

**Explain the Calculation:**
"Let me walk you through how we arrived at that number, because I want this to be completely transparent.

1. **Recent comparable sales:** We looked at [X] similar properties in your area that sold recently. The average sale price was $[Amount].

2. **Property condition:** Based on what you told us about [condition details], we estimated approximately $[Amount] in repairs and updates.

3. **Current market conditions:** The market in [area] is currently [hot/moderate/slow], which affects pricing.

4. **Our costs:** As investors, we factor in holding costs, renovation costs, and our profit margin.

After accounting for all of that, we arrived at a fair cash price of **$[Amount]**.

Does that make sense?"

---

### Value Comparison (2-3 Minutes)

**You:** "I want to show you something important - what you'd actually NET if you sold traditionally versus selling to us."

**Traditional Sale Breakdown:**
"If you listed with an agent at $[Market Value]:
- Sale price: $[Amount]
- Minus agent commission (6%): -$[Amount]
- Minus repairs/updates: -$[Amount]
- Minus closing costs: -$[Amount]
- Minus holding costs (6 months): -$[Amount]
- **Your net: $[Amount]**

Plus, you'd wait 4-6 months with showings, uncertainty, and potential deals falling through."

**Our Cash Offer:**
"With our offer:
- Cash offer: $[Amount]
- Minus commissions: $0
- Minus repairs: $0
- Minus closing costs: $0 (we pay them)
- **Your net: $[Amount]**

And you can close in as little as 7 days, or up to 30+ days if you need more time."

**You:** "So you're actually netting about the same amount, but you get your money in days instead of months, with zero hassle. Make sense?"

---

### Next Steps (1-2 Minutes)

**You:** "If this offer works for you, here's what happens next:

1. **Purchase agreement:** We'll send you a simple purchase agreement to review. You can have your attorney look at it if you'd like.

2. **Inspection:** We'll schedule a quick walkthrough of the property (just to confirm condition).

3. **Closing date:** You choose the date that works best for you - anywhere from 7 to 30+ days out.

4. **Closing:** We handle all the paperwork and closing costs. You just show up, sign, and get your cash.

The whole process is straightforward and we'll guide you through every step.

Does that sound good?"

---

### Closing (1 Minute)

**If They're Ready:**
"Great! I'll send you the purchase agreement today. What email should I send it to?"

**If They Need Time:**
"I completely understand - this is a big decision. What questions do you have that I can help answer?"

**If They're Hesitant:**
"No pressure at all. Why don't you take some time to think it over and we can talk again in a few days? When would be a good time for me to follow up?"

---

## Objection Handling Scripts

### Objection 1: "The offer is too low"

**Response:**
"I understand, and I appreciate you being direct with me. Let me ask - what price were you hoping for?"

**[Listen to their answer]**

"Okay, so you were thinking $[Their Price]. Let me show you why there's a gap.

The key difference is that our offer is a **cash, as-is offer** with zero costs to you. If you want to net $[Their Price], here's what you'd need to do:

- List the property for $[Higher Amount]
- Make $[Amount] in repairs
- Pay $[Amount] in agent commissions
- Pay $[Amount] in closing costs
- Wait 4-6 months

After all that, you'd net about $[Their Price].

With our offer, you get $[Our Offer] in cash, in 7 days, with zero work and zero costs.

So the question is: Is the extra $[Difference] worth 6 months of your time, $[Repair Amount] out of pocket, and all the uncertainty?

For most people in your situation, the answer is no. But I want you to make the decision that's right for you. What do you think?"

---

### Objection 2: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is a big decision and you should take your time. I'd never want you to feel rushed.

Can I ask - what specific concerns do you have that I can help address? Is it the price, the timeline, or something else?"

**[Listen and address specific concerns]**

"Here's what I suggest: Take a few days to think it over. In the meantime, I'll send you:
1. Our offer in writing
2. The net comparison I showed you
3. Some testimonials from other sellers
4. Our BBB profile and reviews

That way you have everything you need to make an informed decision. Sound good?

When would be a good time for me to follow up with you - maybe in 3-4 days?"

---

### Objection 3: "I want to try listing it first"

**Response:**
"That's totally fair, and I respect that. A lot of sellers want to try the traditional route first.

Here's what I'd suggest: Go ahead and list it. Give it 30-60 days and see what happens.

Just know that our offer is good for [X days], so if the listing doesn't work out - maybe you're not getting offers, or buyers keep falling through, or you're tired of the showings - we're here.

Can I follow up with you in [timeframe] to see how it's going?"

**Alternative (if they're on the fence):**
"I get it. But let me ask you this - what if you list it and in 3 months you're in the same position, except now you've spent money on repairs, paid for staging, dealt with dozens of showings, and you're still no closer to selling?

Wouldn't you rather have the certainty of a cash offer and be done with it now?

I'm not trying to pressure you - I just want you to consider the real cost of waiting. What do you think?"

---

### Objection 4: "How do I know this isn't a scam?"

**Response:**
"That's a great question, and I'm glad you're being cautious. There are unfortunately some bad actors out there.

Here's how you can verify we're legitimate:

1. **Check our BBB profile:** We have an A+ rating. [Give them the link]

2. **Read our Google reviews:** We have 200+ five-star reviews from real sellers. [Give them the link]

3. **Verify our license:** We're licensed real estate investors. Our license number is [Number].

4. **Have your attorney review everything:** We encourage you to have a real estate attorney review any paperwork before you sign.

5. **No money upfront:** We never ask you for any money. We pay YOU at closing.

Also, you can Google me - [Your Name] - and see that I'm a real person who's been doing this for [X] years.

Does that help put your mind at ease?"

---

### Objection 5: "I need to talk to my spouse/family"

**Response:**
"Of course! This is a decision you should make together.

Would it be helpful if I spoke with both of you? I'm happy to hop on a call with you and your [spouse/family member] to answer any questions they might have.

Or if you prefer, I can send you all the information in writing so you can review it together, and then we can talk once you've had a chance to discuss.

What works better for you?"

---

### Objection 6: "What if I owe more than the property is worth?"

**Response:**
"That's actually a situation we deal with all the time, and we can still help.

We work with short sales, which means we negotiate directly with your lender to accept less than what you owe.

Here's how it works:
1. We make an offer on your property
2. We submit that offer to your lender
3. We negotiate with them to accept our offer
4. You avoid foreclosure and the hit to your credit

It does take a bit longer - usually 60-90 days instead of 7-30 days - but it's a way to get out from under the property without destroying your credit.

Would you like me to look into that option for you?"

---

### Objection 7: "I have tenants in the property"

**Response:**
"Not a problem at all. We buy occupied properties all the time.

We have a few options:

**Option 1:** We buy the property with the tenants in place and take over the lease. You don't have to do anything.

**Option 2:** If you want the tenants out, we can work with them to relocate. We have resources to help with that.

**Option 3:** If the tenants are on a month-to-month lease, we can give them notice and wait for them to move out before closing.

Which option sounds best for your situation?"

---

### Objection 8: "I need more time to move out"

**Response:**
"No problem! That's the beauty of working with us - you choose the closing date.

We can close anywhere from 7 days to 30+ days out, whatever works for you.

And if you need even more time, we can discuss a rent-back agreement where you rent the property from us for a month or two after closing. That way you get your cash now, but you have time to find a new place and move.

How much time do you think you'd need?"

---

### Objection 9: "Can you go higher on the price?"

**Response:**
"I appreciate you asking. Let me be honest with you - our offer of $[Amount] is based on the numbers I showed you earlier.

For us to go higher, one of two things would need to change:

1. **The property is in better condition than we thought:** If we do our walkthrough and find that it needs less work than estimated, we could potentially adjust the offer.

2. **You're willing to make some repairs:** If you're willing to fix [specific items], we could increase our offer by $[Amount].

But I want to be upfront - we're not going to lowball you and then magically find more money. The offer I gave you is fair based on the information we have.

That said, if you want to list it with an agent and try to get more, I totally understand. Just know that after commissions and costs, you'll probably net about the same.

What do you want to do?"

---

### Objection 10: "I'm not ready to sell yet"

**Response:**
"I understand. Can I ask - what needs to happen before you're ready?"

**[Listen to their answer]**

"Okay, so it sounds like [summarize their situation].

Here's what I suggest: Let's stay in touch. I'll check in with you in [timeframe] and see where you're at.

In the meantime, if anything changes or you have questions, you have my direct number: [Phone].

And just so you know, our offer doesn't expire - if you decide you want to sell in 3 months or 6 months, we'll still be here.

Sound good?"

---

## Call Closing Techniques

### The Assumptive Close
"Great! So I'll send you the purchase agreement today and we can schedule the property walkthrough for this week. Does Thursday or Friday work better for you?"

### The Alternative Close
"Would you prefer to close in 2 weeks or would 30 days work better for your timeline?"

### The Summary Close
"So just to recap: You'll get $[Amount] in cash, we'll pay all closing costs, you don't have to make any repairs, and you can close in [timeframe]. Does that sound like a good solution for you?"

### The Question Close
"What questions do you have that I haven't answered yet?"

### The Direct Close
"Are you ready to move forward with this?"
