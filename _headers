# To enforce these headers in production, configure them in:
# - Cloudflare (Dashboard → Rules → Transform Rules → Response Headers)
# - Or migrate hosting to Netlify/Vercel which support _headers natively
# HSTS must be set at the CDN/server level — cannot be done via meta tag.
# Recommended Cloudflare HSTS: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
