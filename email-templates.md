## Email 3: Day 2 - Educational
**Subject:** How We're Different from Real Estate Agents

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to take a moment to explain how selling to us is different from listing with an agent.

**Traditional Agent Sale:**
❌ 6% commission ($18,000 on a $300k home)
❌ Repairs and updates required
❌ Months of showings and open houses
❌ Buyer financing can fall through
❌ Average time to close: 4-6 months
❌ You pay closing costs

**Selling to FastCashOffer:**
✓ Zero commissions or fees
✓ No repairs - we buy as-is
✓ No showings or disruptions
✓ Cash payment (no financing risk)
✓ Close in 7-30 days (your choice)
✓ We pay all closing costs

**Real Example:**
Sarah inherited her aunt's condo. It needed $30,000 in repairs. An agent wanted her to fix it up first and pay 6% commission.

We bought it as-is for $215,000. She netted more money than if she'd listed it, and closed in 2 weeks instead of 6 months.

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a recent success story that might resonate with you.

**Sarah's Story:**

**The Problem:**
Sarah inherited her aunt's condo in Austin. She lived in Seattle and didn't want to deal with:
• Flying back and forth
• Managing repairs
• Finding an agent
• Waiting months to sell

**The Challenge:**
The condo needed work:
• Outdated kitchen
• Worn carpets
• Minor plumbing issues
• Estimated repair cost: $25,000

**Our Solution:**
We made Sarah a fair cash offer of $215,000 for the condo as-is.

**The Results:**
• Offer received: 24 hours
• Closing date: 10 days
• Repairs needed: $0
• Commissions paid: $0
• Sarah's net: $215,000

## Email 5: Day 7 - Objection Handling
**Subject:** "Is This a Scam?" and Other Questions We Get Asked

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I get it - a cash offer that sounds this good makes people skeptical.

Here are the most common questions we get:

**Q: "Is this a scam?"**
A: No. We're a licensed, local business. Check our:
• A+ BBB Rating
• 200+ Google Reviews (4.9/5 stars)
• Business license: [License Number]
• 10+ years in business

**Q: "Why is your offer lower than Zillow?"**
A: Zillow estimates don't account for:
• Repair costs
• Agent commissions (6%)
• Closing costs
• Time value of money
• Market conditions

Our cash offer factors in all costs, so you know exactly what you'll net.

**Q: "What's the catch?"**
A: There isn't one. We're investors who buy, renovate, and resell properties. We make money on the renovation and resale, not by lowballing sellers.

**Q: "Do I have to decide now?"**
A: Absolutely not. Take your time. Compare our offer to other options. We're here when you're ready.

**Still have questions?**
Let's address them: (555) 123-4567
